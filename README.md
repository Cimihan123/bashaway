# Bash Away 2020

Write a bash script to automate something that you do on a daily basis, something that is boring to do. Think out of the box. The most creative bash script wins a swag pack from the SLIIT FOSS Community. 
## How To

- Fork this repository
- Clone it and create a directory with the name of the script you are writing
- Inside the directory, include the script.
- Include your name and details within the script either as an output or a comment.
- Add a README.md describing the script, what it does and how one could use it.
- Open a PR and describe what you have done, and why it is just *AMAZING!*

An example has been done for you.

*DO NOT* forget to think out of the box!!!
